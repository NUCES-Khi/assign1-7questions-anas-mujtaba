## Q1
Q1: Turing's Original Paper on AI (Turing, 1950):

•	Objections still carrying weight: 

The "Argument from Consciousness" and "Lady Lovelace's Objection" still carry weight. The debate on machine             consciousness persists, and AI systems are limited by their programming.

•	Refutations validity:

Turing's refutations are valid to some extent, acknowledging that machines can exhibit intelligent behavior without true understanding

•	New objections:

Ethical concerns, bias in AI algorithms, and job displacement are new objections arising from recent developments.

•	Turing Test prediction:

Turing's prediction of a 30% chance for a computer passing the Turing Test by 2000 appears optimistic, as of 2024, with no AI consistently passing the test indistinguishably from a human.

## Q2
Q2: Tasks Currently Solvable by Computers:
1.	Playing table tennis: Yes, computers can play at a high level.
2.	Driving in Karachi: Partially solvable; challenges include complex traffic and unpredictable human behavior.
3.	Playing bridge: Yes, computers can play at a competitive level.
4.	Discovering and proving new theorems: Limited; AI aids in theorem proving but doesn't replace human mathematicians.
5.	Writing an intentionally funny story: Partially solvable; AI-generated content exists, but true humor comprehension remains a challenge.
6.	Giving legal advice: Limited; AI can assist, but nuanced legal understanding requires human expertise.
7.	Translating spoken English to Urdu: Partially solvable; real-time translation is possible, but challenges remain in idiomatic expressions and context.


## Q3
Q3: Agent for a Familiar Domain:

•	Domain:

Online customer support chat for e-commerce.
    
•	Environment Characteristics:

Accessible: Yes.

Deterministic: No (customer queries are variable)

Episodic: Yes (each customer interaction is distinct)

Static: No (product availability and promotions change)

Continuous: No (distinct interactions)

•	Agent Architecture:

A hybrid architecture combining reactive elements (responding to common queries) and deliberative elements 
      (learning from customer interactions).
